# RePyability
Reliability Engineering Tools

This is a series of tools created to make an open source set of methods to be used by reliability engineers to make it more accessible for students right through to practicing professionals.

The survival statistics are contained in the supporting package "SurPyval".

This package aims to help with the tools needed for specifically reliability engineering problems.

This is very early in the game but happy to have people jump on board to help out!
